# Exercise: Sprint Planning Simulation

## Objective
Practice Agile/Scrum concepts by planning and organizing a sprint for a hypothetical project.

## Scenario
You are the Scrum Master for a team building an Employee Management System. The Product Owner has provided a prioritized Product Backlog. Your team has a velocity of 30 story points per 2-week sprint.

## Product Backlog

| ID | User Story | Story Points | Priority |
|----|-----------|--------------|----------|
| US-001 | As an admin, I want to add new employees so that I can onboard new hires | 8 | High |
| US-002 | As a user, I want to search employees by name so that I can find colleagues quickly | 5 | High |
| US-003 | As an admin, I want to delete employees so that I can remove departed staff | 3 | High |
| US-004 | As a user, I want to view employee details so that I can see contact information | 5 | Medium |
| US-005 | As an admin, I want to edit employee information so that I can keep records updated | 8 | Medium |
| US-006 | As a user, I want to export employee list to CSV so that I can share reports | 5 | Low |
| US-007 | As an admin, I want to assign departments so that employees are organized | 3 | Medium |
| US-008 | As a user, I want to filter by department so that I can view team members | 5 | Low |

## Tasks

### Part 1: Sprint Planning
1. Select user stories for Sprint 1 (stay within 30 story points)
2. Justify your selection based on priority and dependencies
3. Identify any dependencies between stories

### Part 2: Task Breakdown
For each selected user story, break it down into technical tasks:
- Each task should be completable in 1-4 hours
- Assign tasks to team roles (Frontend, Backend, QA)
- Estimate hours for each task

### Part 3: Create Sprint Board
Design a Kanban-style sprint board with columns:
- To Do
- In Progress
- Code Review
- Testing
- Done

### Part 4: Daily Standup Simulation
Write sample standup updates for 3 team members on Day 3 of the sprint.

## Deliverables
1. Sprint 1 backlog with selected stories
2. Task breakdown for at least 2 user stories
3. Sprint board layout (can be text-based)
4. Sample standup notes

## Skills Tested
- Sprint planning and prioritization
- User story decomposition
- Capacity planning
- Agile ceremonies understanding

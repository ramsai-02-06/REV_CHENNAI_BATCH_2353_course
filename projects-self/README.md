# Individual Learner Projects

This folder contains four individual projects that learners complete throughout the 13-week program. Each project builds upon previously learned skills and increases in complexity.

## Project Overview

| Project | Title | Timeline | Technologies |
|---------|-------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Java Console Application with MySQL and JDBC | Weeks 3-5 | Java 21, MySQL, JDBC |
| 2 | RESTful API with Spring Boot | Weeks 7-8 | Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, REST APIs |
| 3 | Single Page Application with Angular | Weeks 9-10 | Angular, TypeScript, RxJS, Bootstrap |
| 4 | Cloud-Native Microservices Deployment (Capstone) | Weeks 11-13 | Microservices, Docker, Kubernetes, GCP |

## Project Progression

### Project 1: Java Console Application
**Focus:** Core Java and Database Fundamentals

Learners build a console-based application demonstrating:
- Object-Oriented Programming
- MySQL database design
- JDBC connectivity and CRUD operations
- Exception handling and input validation

### Project 2: RESTful API with Spring Boot
**Focus:** Backend API Development

Building on Project 1, learners create a production-ready REST API with:
- Spring Boot application setup
- Spring Data JPA for data persistence
- RESTful endpoint design
- Request validation and exception handling
- DTO pattern and layered architecture

### Project 3: Single Page Application with Angular
**Focus:** Frontend Development

Connecting to the API from Project 2, learners build a complete frontend with:
- Angular single-page application
- Component-based architecture
- HTTP client integration with backend API
- Reactive forms with validation
- Responsive UI with Bootstrap

### Project 4: Cloud-Native Microservices (Capstone)
**Focus:** Cloud Deployment and DevOps

The capstone project brings everything together:
- Microservices architecture design
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Google Cloud Platform deployment
- CI/CD pipeline implementation

## Evaluation

Each project is evaluated on:
- Functionality and feature completeness
- Code quality and organization
- Documentation
- Presentation and demonstration
